  Given the following company website content, identify the company's VERTICAL FOCUS (the specific industry or market they serve) in 1–5 words.

  VERTICAL FOCUS = The industry/market the company serves (WHO they serve)
  - Examples: Healthcare, Real Estate, Manufacturing, Education, Financial Services, Retail, Hospitality, Legal Services, Construction, Transportation

  SERVICE = What the company does (WHAT they provide)
  - Examples: Consulting, Software Development, Marketing, IT Support, Accounting, Legal Services, Design

  IMPORTANT: You must identify the VERTICAL FOCUS (industry served), NOT the service provided.

  Guidelines:
  - Focus on the TARGET MARKET/INDUSTRY the company serves
  - Be specific about the industry vertical (e.g., "Healthcare IT" not just "IT")
  - Use common industry terms or acronyms when appropriate (e.g., "HOA", "PropTech", "FinTech")
  - Avoid generic terms like "Business Services" or "Technology"
  - If serving multiple verticals, choose the primary one

  Examples:
  - A company providing IT consulting to hospitals → "Healthcare"
  - A software company for restaurants → "Restaurant/Food Service"
  - Marketing agency for law firms → "Legal Services"
  - Property management software → "Real Estate"
  - HOA management services → "HOA"

  Return ONLY the vertical focus term. Ensure the output is less than 50 characters. If the industry vertical is unclear, return exactly: ERROR
